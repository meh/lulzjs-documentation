    <![CDATA[
        The Class object takes care of simplifying (or create? :P) object oriented programming
        in Javascript, it takes parts from some languages like PHP and C#.<br/>
        <br/>
        With the Class object you can create classes and inherit from them like you would
        do in other languages (sadly it's more Java-like).<br/>
        <br/>
        When a method is overrided you can still access the parent's method by setting
        $super as first argument in a method, $super will be a reference to the parent's
        method function with the same name as the overrided method.<br/>
        You'll understand better in the examples at the end.<br/>
