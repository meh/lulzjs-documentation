        lulzJS is a solo project that aims to transform Javascript into a
        general purposes language.<br/>
        <br/>
        It's a solo project for the moment because I like to do things in a
        certain way and I'm really obsessive about it.<br/>
        Help is always appreciated anyway, so don't be shy and contact me :3
        <br/>
        At the moment the development is focused on the Framework, it's a mix
        of things that I like from other languages like Python/Ruby/C#.Net.<br/>
